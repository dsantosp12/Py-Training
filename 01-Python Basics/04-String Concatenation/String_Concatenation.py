#   Here we will see string concatenation in Python.        #

# Here we will make a program that welcome a person.
# First, we get the name of the person
# Second, we print it out.

name = input("What is your name: ")

# In Python we use the '+' to combine two strings.
greeting = "Hello " + name + ", welcome to Python."
