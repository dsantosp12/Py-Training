#   Here we will be looking at print(), again, and input(), #
#   but this time in a source code. We will learn how to    #
#   compile Python code using the terminal.                 #

# As mentioned in the file before this one, input() always 
# return a string, even if the user input a number.
# Here we will see how to cast/convert a data type.

# If you enter a number, input() will treat it as a number
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# One way to cast the return value of input(), is the following
height = int(input("What is your height, in cm: "))

# More examples will be shown in the meeting.
